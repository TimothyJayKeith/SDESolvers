# SDESolvers
Contains useful functions for solving SDEs.

Our short term goal is to put into code a wide variety of Stochastic Differential Equations. Long term we wish to be able to develop a package that puts these SDEs into use in practical situations, and eventually to find numerical solutions to SDEs that have not yet been described numerically.
